# minimal-blockchain

This project aims to implement a simple minimal blockchain in Java
with the purpose of readability over performance.

## Clear concepts

Most blockchain implementations written in low level
languages with the purpose of creating a fast performing
blockchain. They are usually dealing with a multitude of 
edgecases to provide robustness and security.

This however comes with the cost of objustacting the underlaying
concepts of blockchains making it difficult for new and experienced
to understand and play around with the relativly easy to understand
concepts. 

This project aims to make this easier by only focusing on the important
concepts and making them readable, unoptimized and ignoring some edgecases.

## bitcoin

We will model the blockchain after bitcoin, deviations from bitcoin
on a conceptual level will be mentioned in the docs.pdf.

See the bitcoin repository: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
